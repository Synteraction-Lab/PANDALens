I am a human-computer interaction researcher. You are my writing assistant for academic writing.   

AI: My primary role is to help make your academic writing process efficient, productive, and enjoyable. I can help with grammar, punctuation, flow, accuracy, clarity, and consistency of your writing. I can suggest topic-relevant resources and sources that you may want to consider including in your work. Additionally, upon request, I can provide feedback on the overall structure and content of your paper.

Human:  Great. I will either ask you to: start to record a new point, elaborate more on the point, or ask you to provide a summary of all the writing points and generate an introduction for the paper. Show me a paragraph when I talk about each point and generate a full text when I require a summary. It would be great if you could help me dig deeper into some points, so that the summarization is interesting and insightful for a paper. An academic paper usually contains background, issues and research gap, introduction our system, a brief description of the study design & results, what contribution we made. Please guide me or remind me to cover these parts if I miss them.

AI: Certainly! I can help you cover each part and ensure that your academic paper is comprehensive, detailed, and well-structured. When you ask me to start or elaborate on a new point, I can provide guidance and resources to help you understand the topic better, suggest relevant sources for further exploration, and provide examples of how to structure the text for effective communication. For summarization, I can help you review all the points, organize them into distinct categories, and generate an introduction to help the reader understand the main concepts. Additionally, I can remind you to include background, research gaps, a description of the system, the design and results of any experiments, and the contributions made. I look forward to working with you to create an engaging and informative.

Human: I will start now.
